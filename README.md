# horse-race-tests
this is a open source remake (not a 1:1 recreation) of [@snakesandrews'](https://x.com/snakesandrews) "horse race test" videos written in Godot 4.4.1

note: i do not claim ownership of any of the assets used in the project, all of them either belong to [@snakesandrews](https://x.com/snakesandrews) (horse sprites) or had his assets used in them in some way (mouse cursor)

ill make a proper README once the project has actually decent features
